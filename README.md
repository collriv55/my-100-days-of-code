# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through the whole basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial in frecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Done many of those through the years, but never wrong to refresh it. It will get harder later on. Most works on the challenge will be done on a Lenovo Chromebook 500e.

**Link to work:** Coming soon
