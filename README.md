# my-100-days-of-code

Log
Day 1: June 9, 2018
Today's Progress: Went through the whole basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial in frecodecamp.org. Twenty seven (27) coding exercises. Did more than 1 hour on these.

Thoughts: Done many of those through the years, but never wrong to refresh it. It will get harder later on. Most works on the challenge will be done on a Lenovo Chromebook 500e.

Day 2: June 10, 2018
Today's Progress: 2nd item in frecodecamp.org's curriculum - Basic CSS (43 exercises, 2+ hours aprox.)

Thoughts: I'll go through some or most of these tutorials, just to refresh what I've done in the last years. Somewhere during the 100 days I'll reroute my efforts to a more specific project.
