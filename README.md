# My-100-days-of-code

Log
Day 1: June 9, 2018
Today's Progress: Went through the whole basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial in frecodecamp.org's first 300 hours Certification (for Responsive Web Design): . Twenty seven (27) coding exercises. Did more than 1 hour on these.

Thoughts: Done many of those through the years, but never wrong to refresh it. It will get harder later on. Most works on the challenge will be done on a Lenovo Chromebook 500e.

Day 2: June 10, 2018
Today's Progress: 2nd item in frecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Basic CSS (43 exercises, 2+ hours aprox.)

Thoughts: I'll go through some or most of these tutorials, just to refresh what I've done in the last years. Somewhere during the 100 days I'll reroute my efforts to a more specific project.

Day 3: June 11, 2018
Today's Progress: 3rd item in frecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Applied Visual Design (49 exercises, 3+ hours aprox.)

Thoughts: Topics are heating up in difficulty. This whole section deserves repeating it several times, specially the second half of it, related to transitions and animations with CSS.
