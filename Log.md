## My 100 Days of Code - Log
(I want to learn: Python + Django/Flask; Javascript/Node.js, GraphQL)
<br>

**Day 1:** June 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went through the whole basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial in freecodecamp.org's first 300 hours Certification (for Responsive Web Design): . Twenty seven (27) coding exercises. Did more than 1 hour on these.

**Thoughts:** Done many of those through the years, but never wrong to refresh it. It will get harder later on. Most of the work on all challenges and projects will be done on a brand new Lenovo Chromebook 500e (shipped with an EMR pen =p ).

**Day 2:** June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2nd item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Basic CSS (43 exercises, 2+ hours aprox.).

**Thoughts:** I'll later revisit some or most of these tutorials, just to refresh what I've done in the last years. Somewhere during the 100 days I'll reroute my efforts to a more specific project.

**Day 3:** June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Applied Visual Design (49 exercises, 3+ hours aprox.)

**Thoughts:** Topics are heating up in difficulty. This whole section deserves repeating it several times, specially the second half of it, related to transitions and animations with CSS.

**Day 4:** June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 4th item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Applied Accesibility (22 exercises, 1.5 hours aprox.).

**Thoughts:** Tons of new atributes and ways to add better accesibility. Definitely, although a short tutorial, is a mega important one.

**Day 5:** June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 5th and 6th items in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Responsive Web Design Principles (4 exercises,  30 mins aprox.). And, CSS Flexbox (17 challenges, 1.0 hour).

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is a totally new topic for me. Powerfull stuff. Tomorrow is CSS Grid (heard and read so much about it). And then my first project @freecodecamp.org!. Seems perfect timing with the weekend. 

I need to learn more about using Github. Fantastic resource. I will also start Python soon for the first time ever.

Someone said coding modifes your way of thinking and living through your day(s). It's true. I feel more focused and organized. I'm starting to think we are all -more complex- coded machines, coding less complex ones, which may someday emulate or outperform us all...

**Day 6:** June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 7th item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - CSS Grid (22 challenges, 1 hour).

**Thoughts:** This is a totally new subject to me. Almost got stuck in the last 2 exercises. But they were easier than what my mind was thinking they were. Fortunately I'm familiar with CSS. However, it has acquired so many aditional features, properties, etc. CSS has surely become a specialization in web development.

Tomorrow will start my first project!

**Day 7:** June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 1st Project in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Tribute Page (1.5 hours).

**Thoughts:** Did most of the HTML and a bit of the CSS. Tomorrow will go into the styling overall, including the responsive elements.

**Day 8:** June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 1st Project in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Tribute Page (X hours).

**Thoughts:**  Finished the requirements and passed the tests. But it's all too basic, no thoughtful design. Not apt for presentation. So I'll give it another day or 2 to have it better presented.

**Day 9:** June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Still on 1st Project in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Tribute Page (0 hours).

**Thoughts:**  Took the time to day to study some options. I'm surprised that the Google Store doesn't have a good SFTP client with local/remote views. Neither does it have a decent HTML editor. Surely will get some when Chrome renders Linux apps.

**Day 10:** June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** "If you're a developer you should have learned git yesterday"... Decided to start learning Git before getting any further. 1.5 hours).

**Thoughts:**  Googled "Learn Git" and went to Codeacademy.com as my first choice. However, at 25%, during the "git checkout" lesson, the CLI didn't take any text input. Instead, the text field acted like I wsa trying to find a string on the text/code shown. Tried with Firefox and the same thing happened. Tried to report a bug but neither taping on the screen nor click on that option with a mouse would result in anything. So, seems I can't get any further and can't report the bug. Will seek other options for the next days.

**Day 11:** June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went back to my first project in freedocecamp.org to fix some things that left me searching.

**Thoughts:**  It's not hard to do and pass the projects (so far). But each project ends up asking more from you, in terms of presentation.

**Day 12:** June 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2nd Project @ freecodecamp.org - Build a Form.

**Thoughts:**  What should have been an easy ride, became a dead end on User Story #13. Searched the forum but didn't find anyone with an issue with this. Will continue tomorrow. Long day today.

**Day 13:** June 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2nd and 3rd Projects @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Form" and "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Attacked the form again and finally found -after visiting the forum again- what was generating the error when trying to pass the test. There was nothing wrong with the code. The User Story is a bit confusing on what it's asking. It asked for the "name" of the radio buttons. But what was really missing was the "value" atribute, which I had included in another fieldset but not in one of them. Sheesh...

**Day 14:** June 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Went over the landing page. But not too much progress neither time, too tired after driving for 10 hours today.

**Day 15:** June 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Several errors when ran the tests. Will continue tomorrow.

**Day 16:** June 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Fixed all errors. But not without some degree of frustration. I think some test weren't well made. I can unederstand that some questions should move the student to a research. But sometimes seems that the User Story is mislleading on purpose, or just wasn't well reviewed.

**Day 17:** June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 4th and 5th Projects @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Technical Documentation Page" and "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage"

**Thoughts:**  Took some extra time today for this. Started the 4th yesterday and continued today. Again, several errors. Most were fixed soon enough, but had to search the forum for answers on 2 items. Finished the project though. 

I haven't been styling because otherwise it would take so much time and my curiosity over new topics is killing me. I do want to get the certification to motivate myself further, hence I've been concentrating only on the code. Anyway, all these projects are great to caom back and practice more and definitely do styling.

Also, started the 5th project this afternoon.

(Edit: Finished the 5th Project. Was rather an easier one. Not sure how they grant the certification. I hope they don't get picky about by lack of styling the projects.)

**Day 18:** June 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Revisited 1st Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Tribute Page"

**Thoughts:** Next tutorials are the JavaScripts ones. I decided to go back to all Responsive Web Design projects and work more on them, before I dip myself into JS, which to me will be like learning russian from scratch. I'm not totally unfamiliar with JS. But never worked on it. The most I had done is take a free script and apply it to a site as per the instructions provided. 

JS will be great...

**Day 19:** June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Revisited 1st, 2nd ,3rd and 4th Projects @ freecodecamp.org (around 4 hours)

**Thoughts:** Need a day off after 18 days in a row. Went back to the initial projects to work more on content and styles (CSSs). Ran tests again, just in case. All went well. 

Also started some CSS at Sololearn. Nice web app for learning.

Edit: Was too curious about JS @freecodecamp.org. So started the first 4-5 lessons.

**Link to work done:** None today.

**Day 20:** June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Javascript tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Started JS yesterday and continued today. Not sure I like it, honestly. My first impressions is that is kind of a capricious language. But at this level I can't really have a sound opinion. Nonetheless, it hints me as the reasons why Python was born.
