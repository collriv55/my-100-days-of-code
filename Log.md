## My 100 Days of Code - Log
(I want to learn: Python + Django/Flask; Javascript/Node.js, GraphQL)
<br>

**Day 1:** June 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went through the whole basic HTML and HTML5 tutorial in freecodecamp.org's first 300 hours Certification (for Responsive Web Design): . Twenty seven (27) coding exercises. Did more than 1 hour on these.

**Thoughts:** Done many of those through the years, but never wrong to refresh it. It will get harder later on. Most of the work on all challenges and projects will be done on a brand new Lenovo Chromebook 500e (shipped with an EMR pen =p ).

**Day 2:** June 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2nd item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Basic CSS (43 exercises, 2+ hours aprox.).

**Thoughts:** I'll later revisit some or most of these tutorials, just to refresh what I've done in the last years. Somewhere during the 100 days I'll reroute my efforts to a more specific project.

**Day 3:** June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Applied Visual Design (49 exercises, 3+ hours aprox.)

**Thoughts:** Topics are heating up in difficulty. This whole section deserves repeating it several times, specially the second half of it, related to transitions and animations with CSS.

**Day 4:** June 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 4th item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Applied Accesibility (22 exercises, 1.5 hours aprox.).

**Thoughts:** Tons of new atributes and ways to add better accesibility. Definitely, although a short tutorial, is a mega important one.

**Day 5:** June 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 5th and 6th items in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - Responsive Web Design Principles (4 exercises,  30 mins aprox.). And, CSS Flexbox (17 challenges, 1.0 hour).

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is a totally new topic for me. Powerfull stuff. Tomorrow is CSS Grid (heard and read so much about it). And then my first project @freecodecamp.org!. Seems perfect timing with the weekend. 

I need to learn more about using Github. Fantastic resource. I will also start Python soon for the first time ever.

Someone said coding modifes your way of thinking and living through your day(s). It's true. I feel more focused and organized. I'm starting to think we are all -more complex- coded machines, coding less complex ones, which may someday emulate or outperform us all...

**Day 6:** June 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 7th item in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)"  - CSS Grid (22 challenges, 1 hour).

**Thoughts:** This is a totally new subject to me. Almost got stuck in the last 2 exercises. But they were easier than what my mind was thinking they were. Fortunately I'm familiar with CSS. However, it has acquired so many aditional features, properties, etc. CSS has surely become a specialization in web development.

Tomorrow will start my first project!

**Day 7:** June 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 1st Project in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Tribute Page (1.5 hours).

**Thoughts:** Did most of the HTML and a bit of the CSS. Tomorrow will go into the styling overall, including the responsive elements.

<hr>

**Day 8:** June 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 1st Project in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Tribute Page (X hours).

**Thoughts:**  Finished the requirements and passed the tests. But it's all too basic, no thoughtful design. Not apt for presentation. So I'll give it another day or 2 to have it better presented.

<hr>

**Day 9:** June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Still on 1st Project in freecodecamp.org's "Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)" - Tribute Page (0 hours).

**Thoughts:**  Took the time to day to study some options. I'm surprised that the Google Store doesn't have a good SFTP client with local/remote views. Neither does it have a decent HTML editor. Surely will get some when Chrome renders Linux apps.

**Day 10:** June 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** "If you're a developer you should have learned git yesterday"... Decided to start learning Git before getting any further. 1.5 hours).

**Thoughts:**  Googled "Learn Git" and went to Codeacademy.com as my first choice. However, at 25%, during the "git checkout" lesson, the CLI didn't take any text input. Instead, the text field acted like I wsa trying to find a string on the text/code shown. Tried with Firefox and the same thing happened. Tried to report a bug but neither taping on the screen nor click on that option with a mouse would result in anything. So, seems I can't get any further and can't report the bug. Will seek other options for the next days.

**Day 11:** June 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went back to my first project in freedocecamp.org to fix some things that left me searching.

**Thoughts:**  It's not hard to do and pass the projects (so far). But each project ends up asking more from you, in terms of presentation.

**Day 12:** June 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2nd Project @ freecodecamp.org - Build a Form.

**Thoughts:**  What should have been an easy ride, became a dead end on User Story #13. Searched the forum but didn't find anyone with an issue with this. Will continue tomorrow. Long day today.

<hr>

**Day 13:** June 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 2nd and 3rd Projects @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Form" and "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Attacked the form again and finally found -after visiting the forum again- what was generating the error when trying to pass the test. There was nothing wrong with the code. The User Story is a bit confusing on what it's asking. It asked for the "name" of the radio buttons. But what was really missing was the "value" atribute, which I had included in another fieldset but not in one of them. Sheesh...

**Day 14:** June 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Went over the landing page. But not too much progress neither time, too tired after driving for 10 hours today.

**Day 15:** June 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Several errors when ran the tests. Will continue tomorrow.

**Day 16:** June 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 3rd Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Landing Page".

**Thoughts:**  Fixed all errors. But not without some degree of frustration. I think some test weren't well made. I can unederstand that some questions should move the student to a research. But sometimes seems that the User Story is mislleading on purpose, or just wasn't well reviewed.

**Day 17:** June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 4th and 5th Projects @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Technical Documentation Page" and "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage"

**Thoughts:**  Took some extra time today for this. Started the 4th yesterday and continued today. Again, several errors. Most were fixed soon enough, but had to search the forum for answers on 2 items. Finished the project though. 

I haven't been styling because otherwise it would take so much time and my curiosity over new topics is killing me. I do want to get the certification to motivate myself further, hence I've been concentrating only on the code. Anyway, all these projects are great to caom back and practice more and definitely do styling.

Also, started the 5th project this afternoon.

(Edit: Finished the 5th Project. Was rather an easier one. Not sure how they grant the certification. I hope they don't get picky about by lack of styling the projects.)

**Day 18:** June 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Revisited 1st Project @ freecodecamp.org - "Build a Tribute Page"

**Thoughts:** Next tutorials are the JavaScripts ones. I decided to go back to all Responsive Web Design projects and work more on them, before I dip myself into JS, which to me will be like learning russian from scratch. I'm not totally unfamiliar with JS. But never worked on it. The most I had done is take a free script and apply it to a site as per the instructions provided. 

JS will be great...

**Day 19:** June 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Revisited 1st, 2nd ,3rd and 4th Projects @ freecodecamp.org (around 4 hours)

**Thoughts:** Need a day off after 18 days in a row. Went back to the initial projects to work more on content and styles (CSSs). Ran tests again, just in case. All went well. 

Also started some CSS at Sololearn. Nice web app for learning.

Edit: Was too curious about JS @freecodecamp.org. So started the first 4-5 lessons.

**Link to work done:** None today.

**Day 20:** June 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Javascript tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Started JS yesterday and continued today. Not sure I like it, honestly. My first impressions is that is kind of a capricious language. But at this level I can't really have a sound opinion. Nonetheless, it hints me as the reasons why Python was born. 

**Link to work done:** None today.

<hr>

**Day 21:** June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Javascript and Python tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** More Python than JS today.  Didn't work much, but was more than 2 hours. 

**Link to work done:** None today.

<hr>

**Day 22:** July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Python tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Kept with Python. I'm liking it. Went throught the "while", if/else, break, continue, etc.

Also, I've been searching for weeks for a mid-range DSLR camera. After reading dozens of reviews, ended up buying a Pentax K-3 II, with a couple of lenses ranging from standard (50mm) to wide-angle to a zoom/telephoto. My wish was a full-frame but can't go into that kind of expense. Got a 24MP ASP-C for around 1/2 the price.

**Days 23:** July 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Python tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Python's getting very complicated. I'm in a part where it seems I can't get any further without getting lost.  I'm guessing I'll go back to previous topics more frequently. 

In the quizzes @Sololearn would be great if there's an explanation of why any given answer is correct. This is not necesarily obvious in some cases.

**Day 24:** July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Basic Javascript tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Interesting... I went back to the basic 5-6 challenges on the JS tutorial and everything after went super smooth afterwards. All challenges that followed that last one (previously made), felt easier. Not sure why. I think that the teacher in this case left a good example of what he/she was asking. This is important. Some of the challenges were passed in the first attempt.

**Day 25:** July 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Basic Javascript tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** So much for yesterday's "easiness". Today got stuck in a queue exercise for a couple of hours. Only got through by checking the hint provided. Somehow it didn't fit the order of topics provided.

**Link to work done:** None.

<hr>

**Day 26:** July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read article from co-founder of Udacity, on their take and experience on React Native.

**Thoughts:** No code today. AFter reading the article mentioned, got busy with my new Pentax K-3 II, which arrived today. Searched for weeks for a good mid-range camera. Finally decided for this model.

**Link to work done:** None.

**Day 27:** July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued the Basic Javascript tutorial @freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** Advanced a good portion. But one of the tests did't run at all. Neither on my Chromebook, nor on my Android. After posting the issue in the forum, someone advised of an extra curly bracket. That did the trick...

**Day 29:** July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** NONE

**Thoughts:** Reaching the "Counting Cards" exercise, I came into a complete halt. Didn't understand the explanation, nor what the lesson is asking. I peeped into the solution and saw that it included a few things that were shown in the previous chapters. Nonetheless, the way the exercise is presented, doesn't make any sense to me, in relation to the recently learned topics. 

Extremely frustrated at the moment. Considering an exit from JS and/or from coding at all. Also, today I learned the intolerance of syntax gets on the way to learn in a more naturally way. I think.

**Day 30:** July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Deleted my freecodecamp.org account

**Thoughts:** I wonder if anyone will ever read this log. I'm a total newbie in Javascript and other coding languages, except for HTML and CSS, though not widely familiar with the recent (last 3-4 years) versions. I do have a minor in education. 

In modern times it's considered that the ultimate goal in education is to develop the social skills that will make a citizen a contributor to society. The ultimate goal of an educator is to facilitate the goal of education. However, as I have seen much too often in the Information Technology field, too many are highly skilled, but poorly educated. Too often have I seen people with exceptional talent in an area of technology, but lacking the human, social depth which enables that talent to be much more than a money maker or a troubleshooter.

When a teacher responds to a student, arguing the classic "you should have", without that student even having met the tool or the information that would have solved X issue, then a great damage is done in the process of learning. There is an absolute lack on cronologic order.

I have learned that coding can be of absolute intolerance. Take syntax, for instance. Miss a symbol and nothing will work. Even worse, in a code teaching organisation, if you miss a symbol and you get 2 different responses, or lack of response, then learning is lost or misled. Worst, if the teacher publicly addresses the student saying he/she should have known, because a tool was provided. The tragedy comes when that tool was provided -- way much later in the tutorial, making it impossible to be guessed at all by any student who is getting in touch with the matter for the first time. 

Ultimately, there is a flaw in the system, but as intolerant as syntax is, a coding teacher may be in denial of this flaw, because he, or she, is highly skilled and estimated in their professional field.

Looking into other providers.

**Day 31:** July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started ES6 at progate.com

**Thoughts:** Took a couple of days to search and select another online coding school. Started ES6, but seems to add more complications to JS in terms of syntax. Always the syntax!

Advanced pretty much, but reached an issue in the 2nd chapter. Messaged the team. Waiting for answer.

**Link to work done:** None.

<hr>

**Day 32:** July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress:** ES6 at progate.com; SQL at progate.com

**Thoughts:** Well... There's always a hurdle. Reached a point in ES6 at progate where I can't go further unless I get a membership for $19.99/month. Not sure I want to do that. Other sites are lexx expensive although Progate seems a better finished product. Found a couple of bugs within the tests mechanism. Solve them by resetting the test.

Started SQL in the meantime.

**Link to work done:** None.

<hr>

**Day 33:** July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** SQL at progate.com

**Thoughts:** Started SQL, to get familiar with it, though I've always used PhpMyAdmin. SQL is kinda boring, but easier to learn. Will go as far as the free course allows.

**Link to work done:** None.

**Day 34:** July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Coming back from misfortunes

**Thoughts:** My backpack, with my Chromebook and the papers to renew my passport (with my expired passport), was stolen from my car. Incredibly enough, the woman to stole it, contacted me saying that I had dropped my backpack into her laundry basket. I doubt that very much because I helped her carry that same basket and I would have noticed the backpack on top of the clothing. Anyway, nothing was missing, but was a big setback in this project. Especially psychologically.

I started to work on my gallery site at www.theother.click. Still not sure if I'll go entirely with code I make (html, css, etc.) or installing Wordpress and customizing a theme.
